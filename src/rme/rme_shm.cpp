/*
 * This file implements a simple interface to a shared memory object used
 * to share device configuration between FFADO components.  This is required
 * because a significant amount of device information is not available for
 * reading from the device itself.
 *
 * The idea is that each RME FFADO process will call rme_shm_open() to
 * obtain a pointer to shared memory containing the structure of interest. 
 * If no process has yet created the shared object it will be created at
 * this point; otherwise the existing object will be used.  Each new process
 * to use the object increments a reference count.
 *
 * On exit, processes using this shared object will call rme_shm_close().
 * The reference counter is decremented and if it becomes zero the shared
 * object will be unlinked.  This way, so long as at least one RME process
 * is active (which doesn't have to be the process which created the object
 * initially) the device's configuration will be persistent.
